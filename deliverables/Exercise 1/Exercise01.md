### User Stories

**Corresponding to functional requirements**

As a Visitor I want to see the catalog to see if it's worth registering myself.

As a User I want to be able to reset my password because I'm very forgettable.

As a User I want to be confronted with a nice and trustworthy looking page so I feel comfortable.



**Corresponding to nonfunctional requirements**

As a User I want my password to stay secure so noone else can use my account.

As a User I want to be able to quickly log in to not waste time.

As a User I don't want to be bombarded with unnecessary advertisement because my mailbox is already full.
